NAME
    App::ZofCMS::Plugin::FormFiller - fill HTML form elements' values.

SYNOPSIS
    In Main Config file or ZofCMS Template:

        plugins => [ qw/FormFiller/ ],
        plug_form_filler => {
            params => [ qw/nu_login nu_name nu_email nu_admin nu_aa nu_mm user/ ],
        },

DESCRIPTION
    The module provides filling of form elements from "{t}" ZofCMS Template
    special key or query parameters if those are specified.

    This documentation assumes you've read App::ZofCMS, App::ZofCMS::Config
    and App::ZofCMS::Template

MAIN CONFIG FILE AND ZofCMS TEMPLATE FIRST-LEVEL KEYS
  "plugins"
        plugins => [ qw/FormFiller/ ],

    Your obviously need to specify the name of the plugin in "plugins"
    arrayref for ZofCMS to execute the plugin. However, you'll probably be
    using another plugin, such as App::ZofCMS::Plugin::DBI to fill the "{t}"
    key first, thus don't forget to set right priorities.

  "plug_form_filler"
        plug_form_filler => {
            params => [ qw/login name email/ ],
        },

        plug_form_filler => {
            params => {
                 t_login    => 'query_login',
                 t_name     => 'query_name',
                 t_email    => 'query_email',
            },
        },

    The "plug_form_filler" takes a hashref as a value. The possible
    keys/values of that hashref are as follows:

   "params"
        params => {
                t_login    => query_login,
                t_name     => query_name,
                t_email    => query_email,
        },

        params => [ qw/login name email/ ],
        # same as
        params => {
            login => 'login',
            name  => 'name',
            email => 'email',
        },

    Mandatory. The "params" key takes either a hashref or an arrayref as a
    value. If the value is an arrayref it will be converted to a hashref
    where keys and values are the same. The keys of the hashref will be
    interpreted as keys in the "{t}" ZofCMS Template special key and values
    will be interpreted as names of query parameters.

    The idea of the plugin is that if query parameter (one of the specified
    in the "params" hashref/arrayref) has some value that is different from
    the corresponding value in the "{t}" hashref, the plugin will put that
    value into the "{t}" ZofCMS Template hashref. This allows you to do, for
    example, the following: fetch preset values from the database (using
    App::ZofCMS::Plugin::DBI perhaps) and present them to the user, if the
    user edits some fields you have have the preset values along with those
    changes made by the user.
